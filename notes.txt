create project notes and app api.
add the line api.apps.ApiConfig.

in the api.views we created a function get routes as json response

created url for the view and added it to
the url of the main project

using django restframework
python3 -m pip install djangorestframework
if using restframework we use the decorator api_view in function based while mixins in class based
and the response will not be jsonresponse but response


serializers convert objects to json responses to be passed in 
rest api, using model serializers, 
we created a serializer for the Note model,

for the post method we created the method and use json {"key":"value"} for application/json

cors --> cross origin resource sharing--> blocking of request is to be fixed,
using django-cors-headers, pip install it, python -m pip install django-cors-headers,

flutter and firebase dont have these issues, 'corsheaders' installed_Apps and     'corsheaders.middleware.CorsMiddleware',
in middleware, we have 3 options, cors_allowed_origins, cors_allowed_origin_regexs, cors_allow_all_origins


flutter part,
